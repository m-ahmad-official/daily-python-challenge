# 📢 Day 18 – Daily Python Challenge 🐍

## 🚀 Challenge:
To-Do List App with GUI! ✅📋

## 🔥 Project Goal:
Create a To-Do List App using Tkinter where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## 📌 Features to Implement:
✅ Add Tasks: Users can type a task and click “Add” to include it in the list.
✅ Mark Completed: Clicking a task should mark it as completed (change color or strike-through text).
✅ Delete Task: Users should be able to remove tasks from the list.
✅ Save Data: Save tasks to a file (tasks.txt) so they persist after closing the app.

## 💡 Hint:
Use Tkinter for UI, Listbox for displaying tasks, and file handling to save progress.
