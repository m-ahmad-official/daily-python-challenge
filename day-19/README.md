# 📢 Day 19 – Daily Python Challenge 🐍

## 🚀 Challenge:
Image to ASCII Art Converter 🎨🖼

## 🔥 Project Goal:
Convert an image into ASCII art using Python! The program should take an image as input and generate an ASCII representation of it using different characters.

## 📌 Features to Implement:
✅ Load an Image: Use PIL (Pillow) to open an image.
✅ Resize & Convert to Grayscale: Make sure the image is small enough to be represented in ASCII.
✅ Map Pixels to Characters: Use ASCII characters (@ # * + - .) to represent different shades.
✅ Output ASCII Art: Print the ASCII representation in the console or save it to a file.

## 💡 Hint:
You can use @ # * + - . as different intensity levels. Experiment with cv2, PIL, or numpy to process images efficiently.
